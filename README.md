This project was meant to replicate the work of the 3D-PAWS initiative (https://www.iepas.ucar.edu/core-programs/3dpaws/) and compare the low-cost sensors to that of a higher end network.  The 3D-PAWS initiative provided all the 3D plans as well as instructions on building the system.  They also provided a software image for loading up to the raspberry pi, however that image did not work on our newer version of the raspberry pi and we were forced to rewrite the code a bit which is what is posted here in the repository.

The data from the 3D Printed Weather are also available in this repository.  The instrument compared fairly well early on, but many of the components and sensors started to degrade with time.  Once this work has been published, it will be linked here as well.
